PL/SQL Changes

The function psSQLratesGet has been added to the ResDB.java file.  It can be found on line 1035.

This function is called in gui.java on line 888 instead of the original ratesGet function.

The script INNOperations.sql needs to be compiled for the code to function.


Included is a Makefile for compiling and running the code.


To compile the file:

With the Makefile:
    make all

Without the Makefile:
    javac InnReservations.java gui.java ResDB.java RoomDB.java Reservation.java Room.java

To run the file:

With the Makefile:
    make run

Without the Makefile
    java -cp ojdbc14.jar:. InnReservations


Notes:

Please make sure a ServerSettings.txt file is in the directory.
Please make sure the INN-insert.txt file is in the directory.
ojdbc14.jar file is required for the make to complete.
Due to the use of the Vector raw data type there are compiler warnings which may be ignored.


The files should include:

InnReservations.java
gui.java
ResDB.java
RoomDB.java
Reservation.java
Room.java
INN-insert.txt
ojdbc14.jar
Makefile
